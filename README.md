# tabajara-webserver


**Maintainers:** [feitnomore](https://github.com/feitnomore/)

This is a hack implemented back in 2003, to learn a little bit about C langugage, Threading and Sockets.

This dummy webserver only serves static content and is pretty basic, it doesn't even handle all the request headers sent by the browser.

*WARNING:* Use it at your own risk.
